                <p>The next biggest thing in tech is self-driving cars.The big theory behind the cars are that if we allow our cars to function by system and signals, the number of accidents in a year will lower.
                    Most incidents and mistakes are made because of human error. Humans have a tendency of failing at multitasking, losing focus or just being careless. So it seems like this is impossible and
                    will take years to accomplish, right? Not exactly. Big companies such as Google, General Motors, Apple, and Ford are really
                    pushing the technology. In fact, Google have their prototype on the streets now.</p>

                    <p>Its no where near ready for the market yet, but they are close. The main thing everyone is worried about is car and street
                    regulation. The laws in place right now do not include self driving cars. Most laws imply that the person seated in the driver seat is the driver. Self-driving cars take the blame away from driver and onto who??
                    Well, companies such as Volvo has put themselves as the targets of lawsuits and "would take the blame if any of its self-driving cars crashes in autonomous mode." With the blame dispute now put at a rest, there will
                    have to be a discussion on how exactly the cars will reads sign for situations such as detours. With that in mind, the technology still has years of development ahead.

                <p>University of Minnesota have created history! They have developed a robotic arm that can be controlled by the human mind. They hope the new development will help those who are paralyzed or have trouble with their arms.
               To make the robot arm move, the controller only has to imagine moving their arms. The most critical piece of the project is the electroencephalography (EEG) cap. It records weak electrical activity of the controllers
                   brain and convert the "thoughts" to reality through the robotic arm. To test the technology, the school picked 8 healthy random subjects to complete the experimental checkpoints.
                   All eight were able to control the arm. According to researcher Bin He, the next step is to
                   examine how examine how this technology could work with someone who has had a stroke or is paralyzed. I think this is a great step forward and I can't wait to see more. The only question
                    I see is how he can use the technology while attached to someone and how the technology will be moved for everyday people.

            <p>Scientists from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore have created a ultrasound device that create images through 3D printed lenses. The device will allow doctors to have better control and precision when operating.
            They hope it will be very helpful in terms of killing tumours, lossen blood clots, and deliver drugs into targeted cells. The lenses the device uses are 3D printed and therefore cheaper and easier to produce.
            Most ultrasounds are limited to spherical shapes, however the 3D printed lenses can allow more complex shapes.

                </figure>
                <p>As a result, images are sharper.  The 3D printed lenses allow ultrasound waves to be at multiple sites or shape the focus specially to a target. </p>
                The new ultrasound device overcomes the limits of glass. It opens new doors for research and medical surgey.
                It also will promote new medical techniques and research opportunities. It will really be helpful when it comes to
                cancer research and procedures. With the new technology, doctors will be able to tell the difference of cancerous cells and non-cancerous cells.

                <p>Google conquered internet search. It is having a tougher time winning the rapidly growing cloud-computing industry.
                    Google must build more credibility among corporations wary of running their businesses on the servers of an internet-search company with little experience supporting the
                    technology needs of big companies, other than its own. The shift to cloud computing threatens to displace billions of dollars of tech spending as companies from corporate giants to hot
                    startups store their data and run their digital businesses on other companies' computer servers.The company's cloud business had been geared toward app developers and tech firms, and
                    some of its biggest clients are still Snap Inc. and Spotify AB.Google is now bolstering its services for traditional companies by hiring workers specialized in industries such as health care, finance and retail,
                    to help make Google's cloud products work for those sectors. Google said it added more cloud employees than any other division last year, and is in the process of hiring 1,000 employees focused on cloud customers.
                    I can understand how Google is not making it the cloud computing world. Google is all about open windows to information and its through
                    search engines such as Google that people can go around firewalls, paywalls and leak information. As a business owner, I too
                    will be cautious. What if there is a glitch or accident and your data is open tot he public. For Google to make this work, they will have to create
                    a whole new sector with new employees only dealing with cloud computing

                <p>
                    The Internet of Things revolves around increased machine-to-machine communication; it’s built on cloud computing and networks of data-gathering sensors; it’s mobile, virtual, and
                    instantaneous connection; and they say it’s going to make everything in our lives from streetlights to seaports “smart.”
                    The real value that the Internet of Things creates is at the intersection of gathering data and leveraging it.
                    The Internet of Things doesn’t function without cloud-based applications to interpret and transmit the data coming from all these sensors. The cloud is what enables the apps
                    to go to work for you anytime, anywhere.

                    The Internet of Things is a very imaginative idea. When the author brings up the bridge
                    sensors, I can only imagine what else they can do. I think back to the self driving car and how a sensor can
                    automatically stop a car if there is a car. I can see what the author is saying about people thinking too small.
                    With Internet of Things we can create systems that can save lives and make procedures go by smoothly and faster.
